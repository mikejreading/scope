# Enterprise School Management Platform: Detailed Requirements Document

## 1. Overview & Design Principles

### 1.1. Introduction and Project Goals

This document serves as the foundational blueprint, articulating the comprehensive and granular requirements for the development of an enterprise-grade school management platform. The genesis of this project stems from a critical need to modernise and optimise the intricate daily operations inherent in educational institutions, fostering an environment of efficiency, transparency, and enhanced collaboration. Our overarching objective is to architect a system that not only streamlines administrative tasks and academic processes but also profoundly enriches the communication ecosystem connecting pupils, parents, teachers, staff, and school administrators. At its core, the platform is conceived as a robust, scalable, and highly secure solution, inherently designed for extensibility to gracefully accommodate the evolving pedagogical and operational demands of the modern educational landscape. This platform will empower schools to operate more effectively, allowing educators to focus on teaching and administrators on strategic management, all while upholding the paramount importance of data integrity and privacy.

### 1.2. Key Design Principles

The successful realisation of this platform hinges upon adherence to a stringent set of core design principles. These principles will guide every architectural decision, development choice, and operational strategy, ensuring the system's resilience, adaptability, and long-term viability within a dynamic educational environment. All of the modules will be chargable, so we need to ensure they can be easily switched on or off per school.

- **Security Focus: The Unwavering Priority**

  - Data security is not merely a feature; it is the bedrock upon which this entire platform is built. Recognising the exceptionally sensitive nature of pupil, staff, and family information, every single aspect of the application, from the underlying infrastructure design to the granular implementation of each feature, must demonstrably prioritise data protection. This commitment mandates the implementation of robust, multi-layered access controls, state-of-the-art encryption for data both in transit and at rest, and continuous, proactive security monitoring. The "why" here is non-negotiable: safeguarding vulnerable individuals and maintaining trust with parents, staff, and regulatory bodies. Any compromise on security directly undermines the platform's utility and the institution's integrity.

- **Multi-Tenancy with Logical Separation: Scalability with Isolation**

  - The platform is engineered to serve multiple independent schools concurrently within a shared, centralised infrastructure. This multi-tenant architecture offers significant cost efficiencies and simplified maintenance overhead. Crucially, while resources may be shared, the data belonging to each individual school (tenant) must be **rigorously and logically separated**. This means that mechanisms must be in place to guarantee that one school's sensitive data is never, under any circumstances, inadvertently or maliciously exposed to or accessible by another school's users. The sole exception to this rule is explicitly authorised platform administrators, whose actions will be subjected to the highest level of auditing. This logical isolation is paramount for data privacy, compliance (e.g., GDPR), and maintaining client trust. It should also be noted that a collection of schools could be created as a 'trust', this may mean that a hierarchy of tenants need to exist where MAIN TENANT 1 could have several child tenants underneath, the main tenant should have access to all child tenants, but the child tenants should only see their own data.

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD): Quality by Design**

  - A rigorous and unwavering Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology will be embraced across the entire development lifecycle. This principle dictates that comprehensive automated tests will be meticulously crafted _before_ any corresponding application logic is written. This "test-first" approach is foundational for several reasons: it inherently drives cleaner, more modular, and more maintainable code designs; it provides immediate feedback on functionality and regressions, significantly reducing bug introduction; and it ensures a high level of code quality and reliability from inception. Within the development environment, tests will leverage mocking frameworks to isolate components and dependencies, enabling rapid iteration and focused testing without reliance on external services or complex setups.

- **Extensibility: Built for the Future**

  - The educational landscape is in constant flux, with evolving pedagogical methods, administrative requirements, and technological advancements. Therefore, this platform must be architected with an innate capacity for future growth and adaptation. A modular, loosely coupled, and highly extensible architecture will be employed. This design philosophy will facilitate the seamless integration of new features, allow for the efficient addition of custom functionalities (e.g., school-specific plugins or integrations), and enable smooth updates without necessitating substantial re-engineering of existing core components. This ensures the platform remains relevant and valuable over its operational lifespan, minimising technical debt and maximising long-term return on investment.

- **Responsiveness and Accessibility (UI/UX): Inclusive User Experience**

  - The user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) are critical to widespread adoption and user satisfaction. All frontend interfaces will be meticulously designed to be fully **responsive**, fluidly adapting and optimising their layout and functionality across a diverse range of devices and screen sizes, from large desktop monitors to tablets and smartphones. Beyond responsiveness, the platform's UI will be built with a profound commitment to **accessibility**, strictly adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. This ensures that the platform is usable, perceivable, understandable, and robust for individuals with diverse abilities, including those who rely on assistive technologies. An inclusive design ensures equitable access to critical information and functionalities for all stakeholders.

- **Internationalisation (i18n): Global Readiness (UK Focus)**

  - While the initial deployment targets the UK market, the platform will be engineered from the outset to support multiple languages and cultural conventions (e.g., date formats, number formatting, currency). This Internationalisation (i18n) capability is achieved by externalising all user-facing text strings. Typically, this involves storing unique keys on the frontend pages, with corresponding translated values managed in a centralised database or content management system. This architectural choice future-proofs the platform for potential expansion into diverse linguistic communities and allows for nuanced localisation even within the UK (e.g., Welsh language support).

- **Auditability: Accountability and Transparency**

  - A robust and comprehensive audit trail will be maintained for virtually all user actions, with particular emphasis on those involving sensitive data or administrative privileges. This includes, but is not limited to, login events, any instances of impersonation (as detailed in Section 2.2), records access, data modifications (creation, updates, deletions), and configuration changes. Each entry in the audit log will meticulously capture crucial metadata: the exact timestamp of the action, the unique identifier of the user who performed the action, the type of action, and sufficient detail to reconstruct the event. This detailed historical record is indispensable for compliance (e.g., GDPR, internal policies), conducting forensic investigations in the event of security incidents, resolving disputes, and ensuring unequivocal accountability for all platform activities.

- **API-First Design: Interoperability and Future-Proofing**

  - A fundamental architectural principle is that all core functionalities and data operations within the platform will be exposed and accessible via a set of secure, well-documented, and **versioned** APIs. This API-First approach is not merely an afterthought; it drives the internal modularity of the system, ensuring that different components interact through well-defined interfaces. Crucially, it facilitates seamless and controlled integration with external third-party systems (e.g., existing school MIS systems, payment gateways, specialised learning platforms) and enables sophisticated automation workflows. The consistent versioning of APIs (e.g., `/api/v1/users`, `/api/v2/users`) is paramount for maintaining backward compatibility and allowing for graceful evolution of the platform's capabilities without breaking existing integrations.

- **Monitoring & Uptime: Reliability and Observability**

  - The platform must deliver a high degree of reliability and availability, recognising its critical role in daily school operations. This necessitates the implementation of robust, real-time health monitoring systems, comprehensive metrics collection (e.g., performance, resource utilisation, error rates), and automated alerting mechanisms. These tools will provide immediate notification of any performance degradation, system anomalies, or outright outages, enabling prompt response and resolution. Such proactive monitoring is fundamental to meeting agreed-upon Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for uptime and performance, ensuring continuous operation and user trust.

- **UK-Only Data Residency: Initial Compliance Focus**

  - For the initial phase of deployment and operation, all platform data, including all sensitive pupil and staff information, will be stored and processed exclusively within data centres located within the United Kingdom. This strategic decision simplifies initial compliance efforts, ensuring strict adherence to UK-specific data protection regulations such as the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. While this provides a clear compliance boundary for Phase 1, the underlying infrastructure and data architecture will be designed with the foresight to accommodate potential future expansion into other geographical regions, should business needs dictate, allowing for compliant data residency in different jurisdictions.

- **Defined Terminology: Clarity and Consistency**
  - To ensure unambiguous communication, reduce misinterpretation, and foster a consistent understanding across all stakeholders (product, engineering, operations, and end-users) throughout the entire project lifecycle, the following terms are formally defined and will be used consistently within all documentation and system interfaces:
    - **Staff:** This overarching term broadly refers to any individual officially employed by, or otherwise formally associated with, a school operating within the platform's ecosystem.
    - **Teachers:** A specific and distinct professional role categorised under "Staff," whose primary responsibility is the direct academic instruction and pedagogical guidance of pupils.
    - **SLT (Senior Leadership Team):** A specialised subset of "Staff" members who hold elevated administrative, strategic, and oversight responsibilities within a particular school, often encompassing decision-making authority over school-wide operations and policy.
    - **Reception:** A designated role within "Staff" typically accountable for front-office operations, initial visitor and parent contact, administrative support, and management of general school inquiries.
    - **Teaching Assistants:** Members of "Staff" who provide direct support to Teachers in the classroom, assisting with learning activities, pupil supervision, and individualised pupil support.
    - **School Admin:** A specific administrative role that can be assigned to any qualifying member of "Staff" within an individual school. Crucially, this role grants administrative access and management capabilities _strictly scoped_ to that particular school's data, configurations, and operational parameters, ensuring tenant isolation.
    - **Platform Admin:** These are specialised staff members employed directly by the software development company responsible for the platform. They possess global, overarching administrative access to all data, configurations, and system functionalities across _all_ schools for the explicit purposes of system maintenance, global technical support, infrastructure management, and system-wide policy enforcement. Their actions are subject to the highest level of auditing.
    - **Pupil:** Refers specifically to a young person who is officially enrolled in, and actively attending, a school that is managed through this platform.

## 2. User Roles & Permissions

This section details the various user roles within the platform, their respective access levels, and how permissions are managed, particularly within the multi-tenant environment. The system's design must support a highly granular and configurable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model.

### 2.1. Core User Roles and Scoping

The platform will define a hierarchy of user roles, each with specific capabilities and data visibility, primarily scoped to the school(s) they are associated with.

- **Platform Admin:**

  - **Scope:** Global access to all data and configurations across all schools.
  - **Capabilities:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) access to all pupil, staff, academic, attendance, and configuration data. Can impersonate any user on the platform for testing or support purposes. Can create system-wide announcements.
  - **Rationale:** Essential for system maintenance, global support, troubleshooting, and managing the multi-tenant infrastructure. Their actions must be extensively audited.

- **School Admin:**

  - **Scope:** Full administrative access to data and configurations _only_ for the specific school(s) they are associated with.
  - **Capabilities:** Manage school profile, staff accounts (including assigning roles like Teacher, SLT, Reception, TA), pupil records, class configurations, timetables, announcements for their school, and access all reporting relevant to their school. Can impersonate any user within their _own_ school for support.
  - **Rationale:** Provides local autonomy for school management while maintaining data separation from other tenants.

- **Staff (General):**

  - **Scope:** Access to information relevant to their role within their associated school(s).
  - **Capabilities:** View staff directory, access general school announcements, potentially take attendance registers (configurable by school admin), and other general school-wide functions as defined by their specific sub-role or school configuration.
  - **Rationale:** Provides essential information and tools for non-teaching staff (e.g., librarians, support staff, office staff) without granting unnecessary access to sensitive academic or pupil data.

- **Teacher:**

  - **Scope:** Access to data for pupils and classes they teach within their associated school(s).
  - **Capabilities:** Manage academic records for their classes (homework, grades, projects), record attendance for their classes, communicate with parents of their pupils, view pupil targets, and access staff-specific information.
  - **Rationale:** Enables core teaching responsibilities and communication.

- **SLT (Senior Leadership Team):**

  - **Scope:** Broader oversight within their associated school(s), typically encompassing all academic, attendance, and behaviour data.
  - **Capabilities:** All Teacher capabilities, plus access to school-wide academic performance reports, attendance trends, behaviour analytics, and potentially higher-level staff management functions.
  - **Rationale:** Provides the necessary visibility for strategic decision-making and oversight of school operations.

- **Head of Department (HoD) / Deputy Head of Department (DHoD):**

  - **Scope:** Primarily focused on their specific subject or department within their associated school(s).
  - **Capabilities:** Read access to all academic data (classes, curriculum, assignments, grades, targets) related to their subject. View access to staff information for members within their department. Limited management capabilities related to their subject (e.g., approving departmental resources or setting curriculum standards).
  - **Rationale:** Enables oversight of departmental performance, curriculum delivery, and staff management within a specific academic area.

- **Reception:**

  - **Scope:** Limited to front-office operations and basic pupil/parent information within their associated school(s).
  - **Capabilities:** View basic pupil contact information, manage emergency contacts (if configured), record late arrivals/early departures, and manage general school communications.
  - **Rationale:** Supports daily administrative tasks at the school's reception.

- **Teaching Assistant (TA):**

  - **Scope:** Supports teachers in specific classes or for specific pupils within their associated school(s).
  - **Capabilities:** May include taking attendance, assisting with academic record keeping, and viewing pupil support plans, as configured by the school admin.
  - **Rationale:** Provides necessary access for classroom support roles.

- **Parent:**

  - **Scope:** Access to information _only_ for their own children enrolled in the platform.
  - **Capabilities:** View their child's academic progress, attendance records, timetable, receive announcements relevant to their child/school, update emergency contact information for their child, and communicate with their child's teachers. They cannot access information for other children.
  - **Rationale:** Provides transparency and engagement for parents regarding their child's education.

- **Pupil:**
  - **Scope:** Access to their own personal information, timetable, academic assignments, and school announcements.
  - **Capabilities:** View their personal timetable, assigned homework, academic targets, and school-wide announcements. They cannot access other pupils' data or sensitive information.
  - **Rationale:** Empowers pupils with access to their own educational journey.

### 2.2. Advanced Role Management

- **Multiple Role Assignments:** A single user account must be able to hold multiple roles (e.g., a Staff member who is also a School Admin, or a Parent who is also a Teacher).
  - **Persona Switching:** If a user holds more than one role, the system will provide a clear mechanism (e.g., a dropdown or dashboard toggle) for the user to designate which "persona" they are currently operating under. This ensures the UI and permissions dynamically reflect the chosen role. If a user only has one persona, this option should be hidden.
- **External or Temporary Users:** The system must support the creation and management of temporary or external user accounts with time-limited or highly restricted access. This includes:
  - **Substitute Teachers:** Temporary access to specific classes and pupils for a defined period.
  - **School Inspectors/Auditors:** View-only access to specific data sets for compliance reviews.
  - **Government Bodies:** Highly restricted, view-only access to aggregated, anonymised data as required by law.
  - **School Governors:** View-only access to high-level academic reports, attendance summaries, and communication logs, without editing capabilities.
- **Impersonation Audit Trail:** All instances of platform admins or school admins impersonating another user must be meticulously logged. This audit trail will include the impersonating user's ID, the impersonated user's ID, the timestamp of the impersonation start and end, and the actions performed during the impersonation session. This is critical for security and accountability.
- **Role-Based UI:** The user interface should dynamically reflect the permissions of the logged-in user. Inaccessible features, menu items, or data points should be hidden or greyed out, providing a clear and secure user experience.
- **Inactive Accounts:** The system will support various account lifecycle states to manage user access effectively:
  - **Current:** Active user with full permissions for their assigned roles.
  - **Inactive:** Account is temporarily suspended, preventing login but retaining data. This can be used for staff on leave or pupils who have temporarily left.
  - **Future Joiner:** Account created in advance for new staff or pupils, active on a specified future date.
  - **Locked Out:** Account temporarily locked due to excessive failed login attempts or administrator action, requiring a reset or manual unlock.
- **Cross-Tenant Access Restrictions:** It is explicitly stated that Platform Admins are the _only_ users who can access data across multiple tenants (schools). No school staff member (Teacher, School Admin, SLT, HoD, DHoD, etc.) should ever have cross-school access, unless it is a platform-wide feature explicitly designed for cross-school collaboration (e.g., a shared resource library managed by the platform, not school-specific data).

## 3. Authentication & Security

This section details the authentication mechanisms, security protocols, and data protection measures essential for an enterprise-grade platform handling sensitive educational data. Security is the top priority.

### 3.1. Authentication Methods

The platform will support multiple secure authentication methods:

- **Email/Password Authentication:** Standard username (email) and password authentication for all user roles. Passwords must be hashed using strong, industry-standard algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) and stored securely.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Integration with common identity providers (e.g., Google Workspace for Education, Microsoft 365 Education, SAML 2.0) to allow schools to leverage their existing identity management systems.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Mandatory MFA for all Platform Admin and School Admin roles. Optional but highly recommended MFA for all other user roles (e.g., via authenticator apps, SMS, email codes).

### 3.2. Password and Session Management

- **Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements, no common passwords, history checks).
- **Password Reset:** Secure password reset flows (e.g., via email verification link, not direct password sending).
- **Session Management:** Implement secure session management, including:
  - Short session timeouts for inactivity.
  - Session invalidation upon logout, password change, or account revocation.
  - Secure, HTTP-only cookies for session tokens to prevent XSS attacks.
- **SSO Bypass Fallback:** For Platform Admin and School Admin roles, a secure fallback to email/password login _must_ be enforced in case of SSO failure. For other roles, this fallback can be enabled at the confirmation of a Platform or School Admin if required during an incident. The system must also include a feature to scramble passwords or temporarily remove the ability to bypass SSO once the incident is mitigated, ensuring security is restored.

### 3.3. Impersonation and Access Control

- **Impersonation Logging:** As detailed in Section 2, all impersonation actions by Platform Admins or School Admins must be meticulously logged for auditing purposes.
- **Access Revocation:** Immediate revocation of access upon role change, account suspension, or termination.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Granular RBAC as defined in Section 2, ensuring users only access data and features relevant to their assigned roles and school affiliations.

### 3.4. Data Encryption

- **Encryption in Transit:** All data transmitted between the client (browser/app) and the server, and between internal services, must be encrypted using industry-standard protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2+).
- **Encryption at Rest:** All sensitive data (e.g., pupil personal information, safeguarding notes, medical records, passwords, financial data) must be encrypted at rest within the database and storage systems. This includes disk encryption and potentially field-level encryption for highly sensitive data.

### 3.5. Security Monitoring & Incident Response

- **Security Monitoring:** Implement continuous security monitoring to detect and alert on suspicious activities, including:
  - Unusual login patterns (e.g., from new locations, unusual times).
  - Excessive failed login attempts.
  - Unauthorised access attempts.
  - Data exfiltration attempts.
- **Account Lockouts:** Implement automated account lockout mechanisms after a configurable number of failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **Login Attempt Logging:** Track and log all login attempts (successful and failed), including IP address, timestamp, user agent, and reason for failure. This data is crucial for security analysis and incident response.
- **Audit Log Retention:** All security-related audit logs must be retained for 28 days in a "hot" accessible storage for immediate analysis, and then archived into cold storage for a minimum of 5 years for compliance and historical investigation purposes.
- **CAPTCHA / Bot Protection:** Implement CAPTCHA or similar bot protection mechanisms on public-facing endpoints such as registration, login, and password reset forms to prevent automated abuse and credential stuffing attacks.
- **Security Headers / Best Practices:** The platform will utilise industry-best practices for web security, including:
  - Strict Content-Security-Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS and data injection attacks.
  - X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking.
  - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce HTTPS.
  - Secure flag on cookies.
  - Regular security vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
- **Secure Device and Browser Storage:** Session tokens and other sensitive client-side data will be stored using the most secure browser storage mechanisms, primarily HTTP-only cookies, to minimise exposure to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. LocalStorage will be avoided for sensitive data.
- **Consent & Privacy Notices:** During sign-up or first login, all users (especially parents and pupils) must explicitly accept the platform's privacy policies and terms of use. This consent must be logged and auditable.

### 3.6. Future Enhancements (Post-Phase 1)

- **Biometric Authentication Support:** Explore integration with mobile device biometric authentication (e.g., FaceID, TouchID) for enhanced convenience and security on mobile applications.
- **Device Trust Model:** Implement a feature to allow users to mark devices as "trusted" for longer session durations, reducing the frequency of re-authentication while maintaining security.

## 4. School Configuration

This section outlines the configurable settings that allow each individual school (tenant) to customise the platform to its specific operational needs, branding, and policies, while maintaining the multi-tenant architecture.

### 4.1. School Profile & Calendar Setup

- **Basic School Information:** Ability to configure fundamental school details such as name, address, contact information, school type (e.g., primary, secondary, academy), and unique identifiers (e.g., DfE number, URN).
- **School Calendar:** Configuration of academic years, terms, holidays, half-terms, and inset days. This calendar will drive timetabling, attendance tracking, and academic reporting.
- **Time Configuration:** Schools must be able to define their daily operational hours, including:
  - Standard school start and end times.
  - Definition of lesson periods/blocks (e.g., Period 1, Period 2, duration).
  - Scheduled break times (e.g., morning break, lunch break).
  - Inclusion of pre- and post-school clubs and activities, with their own scheduling blocks. This detailed time configuration is crucial for accurate timetabling and attendance.
  - Attendance should be able to be configurable by school, some schools will only take attendance once daily, others once in the am and once in the PM, others by class. School admins should be able to configure when attendance is to be taken.

### 4.2. Custom Branding & Notifications

- **Theming:** School Admins should be able to create custom themes for their school, including:
  - Selecting primary and secondary brand colours.
  - Uploading a school logo, which will be displayed prominently.
- **Default Light/Dark Mode:** The system will offer default light and dark mode options, with the ability for individual users to select their preference.
- **Notification Preferences:** Schools can configure default notification channels and preferences for different event types (e.g., email for attendance alerts, in-app for announcements).

### 4.3. Role & Permission Customisation

- **Configurable RBAC:** School Admins can customise the granular permissions for Staff sub-roles (Teacher, SLT, Reception, TA, HoD, DHoD) within their specific school. This includes defining which modules they can access and their level of access (view, edit, manage).
- **Delegated Admin Roles:** School Admins should be able to delegate limited administrative rights to other staff members. For example, a "Data Admin" could manage pupil records but not financial settings, or a "Timetable Manager" could only edit schedules. This allows for distributed administrative responsibilities without granting full School Admin control.

### 4.4. Local Policy Enforcement & Service Subscriptions

- **Local Policy Configuration:** Ability to upload or link to school-specific policies (e.g., safeguarding policy, behaviour policy) for easy access by staff and parents.
- **Service Subscriptions:** Schools can enable or disable specific modules or features provided by the platform (e.g., library management, events management, support ticketing). This allows schools to tailor the platform to their immediate needs and budget.
- **Compliance & Regulatory Information:** Add fields for storing school-specific compliance and regulatory identifiers, such as local authority codes, safeguarding contacts, Ofsted/Estyn Unique Reference Numbers (URNs), or any other reporting identifiers required by local educational bodies. Even if not immediately used for platform functionality, these are common in UK school systems and useful for comprehensive record-keeping.

### 4.5. Data Management & Lifecycle

- **Data Retention Configuration:** Schools should be able to configure their own data retention policies for academic records, attendance logs, and communication archives, aligning with their local data protection policies and legal requirements.
- **School Status / Lifecycle:** The system will support various lifecycle statuses for each school, enabling proper operational control and data management:
  - **Not Open Yet:** For schools that are in the setup phase, configuring their data but not yet live with pupils.
  - **Active:** Fully operational school.
  - **Suspended:** Temporarily inactive, preventing login but retaining data.
  - **Archived:** School has ceased operations or left the platform, retaining historical data for compliance without active access.
- **Multi-Campus Support:** The platform will allow schools to define and manage multiple campuses or sites under a single school entity. This includes associating staff, pupils, rooms, and schedules with specific campuses, enabling larger trusts or academies to manage their distributed operations effectively.
- **Language / Locale Settings:** Schools should be able to set a default locale for their instance, influencing date formats, number formatting, and UI language. British English will be the default locale for all new schools. This is important for supporting diverse user bases, including Welsh-medium schools in the UK.
- **Emergency Contact Settings:** Schools should have the flexibility to configure the minimum number of emergency contacts required per pupil and define the specific fields (e.g., name, relationship, phone, address) that must be captured for each contact. This ensures compliance with local safeguarding policies.

### 4.6. Onboarding Checklist

- **Onboarding Checklist for New Schools:** For newly onboarded schools or new school admins, the system will display a progress checklist to guide them through the initial setup process. This checklist will include items such as "Add Staff," "Define School Calendar," "Publish Timetable," and "Configure Emergency Contact Settings," ensuring accountability and a smoother setup experience.

## 5. Academic Management

This section details the functionalities for managing pupil academic information, curriculum tracking, performance assessment, and target setting within the platform.

### 5.1. Pupil & Class Records

- Tracks pupil personal data, safeguarding flags, demographics, SEND, EAL, FSM, pastoral notes, and consents.
- Full historical versioning and audit log of all changes.
- Access controlled by role; parents can view and edit consents only.

* **Pupil Information Storage:** Comprehensive storage of pupil personal information, including demographics, contact details, medical information, and safeguarding flags. Pupils can be members of more than one school (e.g., for shared resources or multi-academy trusts). All personal information must be stored securely.
* **Emergency Contacts:** Pupils can have multiple emergency contacts. Parents should have the ability to update this information for their own children.
* **Class Management:** Storage of class information, including subject, year group, teacher assignments, and maximum class sizes.
* **Ability Grouping:** Classes should be split into different ability categories (e.g., "Advanced," "Core," "Support") to allow children to be placed in the most appropriate learning environment for their ability.
* **Curriculum Tracking:** Ability to link curriculum content to classes and subjects, allowing teachers to track curriculum coverage.
* **Assignment Management:** Teachers can create, assign, and track various types of academic work, including homework, normal class work, exams, coursework, and projects.

### 5.2. Academic Performance & Reporting

- Supports QLA assessments, baseline vs target tracking, Progress 8, and dynamic scoring pathways.
- Workflow includes approval by Head of Department before publishing.
- Intervention triggers and tracking linked to underperformance.

* **Performance Tracking:** Storage of pupil academic information by class, including grades, scores, and feedback for all assigned work.
* **Targets:** Ability to set and track academic targets for each pupil, per class. The system should allow for progress monitoring to see if the pupil is on target to achieve their goals.
* **Reporting:** Generation of academic reports for pupils, classes, and subjects. Reports should be configurable to show grades, progress against targets, and attendance.
* **Assessment Types & Weighting:** Allow schools to define custom assessment types (e.g., formative, summative, mocks, quizzes, presentations). These assessment types can then have configurable weightings applied to them, influencing the calculation of overall grades or progress indicators. This flexibility is essential for diverse assessment strategies.
* **Support for Multiple Grading Scales:** The platform must enable schools to define and utilise different grading schemas based on their pedagogical approach. Examples include traditional A–F letter grades, numerical scales (e.g., 9–1 for GCSEs), percentage-based grading, or mastery bands. This ensures the system can accommodate varying assessment methodologies.
* **Intervention Tracking:** Provide functionality to record and track academic interventions linked to pupil targets. This includes documenting who initiated the intervention (e.g., teacher, SENCO), when it occurred, the type of intervention (e.g., tutoring, mentoring, small group work), and its observed outcome. This supports targeted pupil support.
* **Learning Plans or Individual Pupil Plans (IPPs):** For pupils with Special Educational Needs (SEN), Gifted and Talented (G&T) students, or those identified as at-risk, the system will allow for the attachment of structured learning plans. These plans will include specific goals, support strategies, review dates, and clearly identify the staff members involved in their implementation and oversight.

### 5.3. Data Retention & Pupil Engagement

- **Retention and Archival Policies:** Academic records must adhere to configurable retention and archival policies, which can be set per school. This ensures compliance with data protection regulations and allows for historical data access even after a pupil leaves or graduates.
- **Pupil Reflection/Journaling:** Provide a dedicated space for pupils to submit self-reflections, journal entries, or personal goals related to their learning. This feature will be configurable:
  - By default, it can be hidden from parents, though parents could be granted view access if the school configures it.
  - By default, it will be hidden from staff, but staff members (e.g., teachers, pastoral leads) can request access to a pupil's journaling if it is deemed necessary for their support, with appropriate audit trails.
- **Automated Alerts:** The system will generate automated alerts to notify staff or parents if a pupil's academic performance drops below predefined thresholds, if assignments are consistently missing, or if progress against targets deviates significantly. These alerts should be configurable by the school.

### 5.4. Cross-School Access

- **Staff Access:** Staff members from a particular school should have access to pupil information _only_ from that school, not from other schools.
- **Platform Admin Access:** Platform admins should have access to all pupil records across all schools.

### 5.5. Medical Information Management & Alerts

Due to the highly sensitive and critical nature of pupil medical information, a dedicated focus on its management and associated alerts is paramount for day-to-day safety and robust data security.

- **5.5.1. Detailed Medical Records:** The platform will provide secure storage for comprehensive medical information for pupils. This includes, but is not limited to:
  - Detailed lists of allergies (food, medication, environmental).
  - Information on chronic conditions (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy), including diagnosis dates and severity.
  - Records of prescribed medications, including dosage, frequency, and administration instructions.
  - Defined emergency protocols or action plans for specific conditions (e.g., anaphylaxis action plan).
  - Ability to upload supporting medical documents (e.g., doctor's notes, care plans, diagnosis reports).
- **5.5.2. Strict Access Control for Medical Data:** Access to this highly sensitive data will be governed by exceptionally strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Only explicitly authorised staff roles will have access, ensuring adherence to the principle of least privilege. This typically includes:
  - Designated school nurses or medical staff.
  - First aiders.
  - Relevant teachers _on a strict need-to-know basis_ (e.g., for pupils in their direct care during a specific activity or trip).
  - Platform Admins will have access for system maintenance and support purposes only, with every access meticulously audited.
  - Parents will _not_ have direct view access to the full detailed medical records of other pupils.
- **5.5.3. Medication Administration Log:** The system will include a dedicated log for tracking all instances of medication administered to pupils within the school. This log will record:
  - Date and time of administration.
  - Medication name and dosage.
  - The staff member who administered the medication.
  - Observations of the pupil's response or any side effects.
  - This log provides an auditable record of medical care.
- **5.5.4. Emergency Medical Alerts:** A mechanism will be implemented to flag critical medical conditions that require immediate attention or specific handling protocols. This includes:
  - Prominent display of critical alerts on pupil profiles for authorised staff.
  - Ability to generate quick-reference medical alerts or lists for staff accompanying pupils on school trips, ensuring essential information is readily available offline if needed.

## 6. Scheduling & Timetabling

This section details the functionalities for creating, managing, and distributing school timetables for pupils, staff, and rooms, encompassing daily schedules, extracurricular activities, and special events.

### 6.1. Timetable Generation & Management

- SLT-driven automatic and manual timetable generation with constraints (availability, double periods, room priority).

* **Custom Timetable Structures:** Schools should be able to define their own timetable structures, including the number of periods per day, duration of periods, and specific timings for breaks and lunch, aligning with the time configuration defined in Section 4.
* **Pupil Schedule Generation:** The system will automatically generate individual timetables for each pupil based on their enrolled classes, ability groups, and any special educational needs.
* **Staff Schedule Generation:** Individual timetables will be generated for each staff member, detailing their assigned classes, duties, and free periods.
* **Room Scheduling:**
  - **Room Information:** Storage of detailed room information, including maximum class sizes, layout (e.g., classroom, lab, hall), and specific features (e.g., projector, interactive whiteboard, number of laptops available). This information will be crucial for timetabling logic to assign the right staff to the right room.
  - **Conflict Resolution:** The timetabling engine must include robust conflict detection and resolution mechanisms to prevent double-booking of rooms, staff, or pupils.
* **Club & Extracurricular Scheduling:** Ability to schedule and manage before-school, after-school, and lunchtime clubs and activities, integrating them into pupil and staff timetables where applicable.

### 6.2. Advanced Timetabling Features

- Staff can request temporary room changes.
- Visibility, export settings, and printing rules configurable by role.

* **Substitute/Cover Scheduling:** The platform will include robust support for designating substitute teachers when regular staff are unavailable due to absence. This functionality should include:
  - Notification of cover assignments to substitute teachers and affected classes/pupils.
  - Integration with absence tracking (Section 7).
  - Ability to view the original teacher's lesson plans or resources for the covered period.
* **Timetable Versioning:** The system will support multiple versions of a timetable (e.g., "Initial Draft," "Term 1 Final," "V2.1"). This allows for iterative planning and review without disrupting live operations. Controlled publishing mechanisms will ensure that changes only go live when approved.
* **Change Notifications:** Automated notifications will be sent to affected users (pupils, staff, parents) when a timetable change occurs, especially for critical changes like room alterations, time shifts, or staff substitutions. Notifications should be clear and highlight the specific changes.
* **Event Blackout Dates:** Schools should be able to block specific days or periods from general scheduling (e.g., exam days, school trip days, open days, building maintenance). These blackout dates should override normal timetabling logic.
* **Exam & Assessment Scheduling:** Dedicated support for scheduling non-classroom-based events like exams, mock tests, or larger assessments. This includes:
  - Defining different durations for exams.
  - Assigning invigilators.
  - Booking specific exam halls or rooms.
  - Managing pupil seating plans for exams.

- Full reporting, with visibility for staff, parents, and pupils.

* **Daily & Per-Lesson Attendance:** Ability to record pupil attendance for each class, on each day, or for specific sessions (e.g., AM/PM).
* **Staff-Wide Register Access:** Any authorised member of staff (not just the assigned teacher) should be able to take a register for a class, provided they have the appropriate permissions configured by the school admin. This supports flexibility in real-world school operations (e.g., TAs, receptionists, cover supervisors).
* **Customisable Attendance Codes:** Schools should be able to define and customise their own attendance codes (e.g., Present, Absent, Late, Authorised Absence, Medical Appointment, On Site but Not in Class, In Isolation, In Intervention). The system will also include statutory attendance codes required by educational authorities.
* **Attendance Alerts:** Configurable alerts for unexplained absences, persistent lateness, or significant drops in attendance, notifying relevant staff (e.g., class teacher, pastoral lead, school admin, parents).
* **Register Audit Trail:** A comprehensive audit trail must be maintained for all attendance records. This includes tracking _who_ submitted or updated attendance, _when_ the action occurred, and any changes made. This is crucial for resolving disputes and auditing irregularities.
* **Partial Day/Session Attendance:** The system must allow for marking attendance by specific sessions (e.g., AM/PM), not just by entire periods or full days. This is especially important for accurately tracking truancy, medical leave, or pupils attending off-site activities for part of the day.

### 7.2. Behaviour Management

- Logs positive/negative events, with categories, escalation paths, and parent visibility rules.
- Tracks individual and aggregate points with thresholds per pupil or year group.
- Behaviour plans and class-register integrations for tracking target achievement.

* **Behaviour Logging:** Ability for staff to log behaviour incidents, including:
  - Date, time, and location of incident.
  - Description of the incident.
  - Pupil(s) involved.
  - Staff member(s) involved.
  - Witnesses.
  - Category of behaviour (e.g., disruption, aggression, bullying, non-compliance).
* **Point Systems & Consequences:** Support for configurable behaviour point systems (positive and negative) and linking incidents to defined consequences (e.g., detention, loss of privileges, restorative justice).
* **RBAC-Driven Visibility:** Behaviour records must have strict RBAC, ensuring only authorised staff (e.g., class teacher, pastoral lead, SLT, school admin) can view specific incidents. Parents should only see behaviour incidents related to their own children.
* **Safeguarding Flag Integration:** Seamless integration with safeguarding flags (e.g., for vulnerable pupils, pupils with a history of specific behaviours), ensuring that relevant staff are alerted to critical information when logging or reviewing behaviour.
* **Behaviour Analytics:** Dashboards and reports showing behaviour trends, common incident types, and impact on learning, allowing schools to identify patterns and implement targeted interventions.
* **Anonymous Reporting:** Provide an optional feature allowing staff or even pupils (if configured by the school) to flag a concern about behaviour or absenteeism confidentially. These reports should be routed directly to the designated safeguarding lead or appropriate senior staff member.
* **Incident Linking:** The system should allow multiple behaviour incidents to be linked together as part of an escalating case or to identify a recurring pattern. This enables comprehensive pastoral tracking and intervention planning over time.
* **Follow-up Tracking:** For each behaviour incident, the system should allow for the tracking of follow-up actions. This includes documenting meetings held (with parents, pupil, staff), outcomes logged, and setting review dates for monitoring progress.
* **Behaviour Support Plans:** For pupils with recurring or significant behaviour issues, the platform should allow for the creation and attachment of structured behaviour support plans. These plans will outline specific goals, agreed-upon support strategies, and identify responsible staff members for implementation and monitoring.

  - Fields for date, time, location, and a detailed description of the incident/concern.
  - Ability to attach supporting evidence (e.g., photos, screenshots, written statements).
  - Automated routing of the report directly and immediately to the Designated Safeguarding Lead(s) (DSL) within the school, ensuring no delays in critical information.
- **7.3.2. Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) Workflow:** The platform will provide a dedicated workflow for DSLs to manage safeguarding cases from initiation to resolution. This includes:
  - A secure dashboard displaying all open, in-progress, and closed safeguarding cases.
  - Tools for DSLs to log all actions taken, including investigations initiated, meetings held (with pupils, parents, staff, or external agencies), and internal discussions.
  - Ability to link multiple related reports or behaviour incidents (from Section 7.2) to a single comprehensive safeguarding case.
  - Functionality to track the progress of a case through various stages (e.g., assessment, investigation, referral, monitoring).
  - Setting and tracking review dates for ongoing cases, ensuring timely follow-up.
- **7.3.3. Multi-Agency Communication Log:** All communications with external safeguarding agencies are critical and must be meticulously logged. The platform will provide secure logging capabilities for:
  - Recording names of agencies contacted (e.g., Social Services, Police, NHS, CAMHS).
  - Dates, times, and methods of communication (e.g., phone call, email, formal meeting).
  - Detailed summaries of discussions, advice received, and actions agreed upon.
  - Identification of the staff member who initiated and conducted the communication.
  - This log ensures an auditable trail for multi-agency collaboration.
- **7.3.4. Extremely Strict Access Control for Safeguarding Cases:** Due to the unparalleled sensitivity of safeguarding information, access will be governed by the most stringent Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) rules. Access will be limited exclusively to:
  - The Designated Safeguarding Lead(s) (DSL) within the school.
  - Other explicitly authorised senior leadership team members (e.g., Headteacher) on a strict need-to-know basis.
  - Platform Admins will only have access for system maintenance, troubleshooting, and audit purposes, with every access meticulously logged and reviewed. Under no circumstances will other staff roles (Teachers, Parents, Pupils, etc.) have access to these confidential case files.
- **7.3.5. Comprehensive Audit Trail:** Every action within the safeguarding module—from the initial report submission to case closure, including viewing a case file, adding notes, modifying status, or logging external communications—will be captured in a comprehensive, immutable audit trail. This trail will include the user ID, timestamp, and detailed action data, providing full accountability and transparency for compliance and review by external bodies.
- **7.3.6. Secure Storage and Encryption:** All safeguarding notes and case files, particularly "confidential_notes," will be subject to enhanced security measures, including encryption at rest (database and file storage) and in transit, ensuring maximum protection against unauthorised access.

## 8. Communication & Messaging

This section details the platform's capabilities for facilitating secure and efficient communication between all stakeholders, including announcements, direct messaging, and notification management.

### 8.1. Messaging & Announcements

- **Safeguarding Visibility:** All communication, especially between teachers and parents, should be visible to designated safeguarding leads or school administrators for monitoring and audit purposes, ensuring child protection protocols are met.
- **Escalation Paths:** For critical unread messages (e.g., urgent safeguarding alerts, emergency announcements), the system should implement configurable escalation paths (e.g., automated reminders, notification to school admin if unread after X hours).
- **"No Longer Relevant" Status:** Instead of deletion, messages and announcements should be allowed to be marked as "no longer relevant." This ensures that parents who haven't read it yet are clearly informed that no further action is required, while preserving the message for audit history.

### 8.2. Advanced Communication Features

- **Message Tagging & Categorisation:** Allow staff to tag messages and announcements with predefined categories (e.g., "Urgent," "Information Only," "Action Required," "Follow-up Needed"). This helps users filter, prioritise, and manage their communications effectively.
- **Parent Contact Fallback:** If a critical message sent to a parent remains unread or unacknowledged after a configurable number of days (X days), the system should allow for escalation. This could involve notifying a secondary emergency contact or flagging the message for direct follow-up by school staff.
- **Templates:** Enable the creation and reuse of customisable message templates for common communications (e.g., trip reminders, absence follow-ups, homework assignments). This saves time and ensures consistency and standardisation in communication.
- **Scheduled Sending:** Users should be able to schedule messages or announcements to be sent at a future date and time. This is useful for preparing communications in advance or for timed alerts.
- **Bulk Messaging:** Provide functionality for staff to select multiple parents, pupils, or groups to send the same message simultaneously (e.g., sending a reminder to everyone who missed a homework task, or an update to a specific year group).
- **Access Logs:** Record who accessed (viewed) an announcement or message and when. This provides accountability for critical communications, allowing schools to verify that information has been seen.
- **Parent Acknowledgment:** Implement a mechanism for parents to explicitly "acknowledge" a message or announcement. This provides positive confirmation to the school that the communication has been read and understood, which is particularly important for consent forms, policy updates, or critical alerts.
- **Distribution Lists:**
  - **School-Created Distribution Lists:** Schools should be able to create and manage their own custom distribution lists (e.g., "Bus Route 1 Parents," "After-School Club A," "Year 7 Parents"). This allows for targeted communication when an issue affects a specific group of children.
  - **Temporary Groups:** The system should support the creation of temporary communication groups, for example, for a specific field trip, event, or short-term project. These groups can be easily created and dissolved.
