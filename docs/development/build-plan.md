## Overview

This document outlines the detailed build plan for the School Management Platform, organized into logical phases that deliver incremental value while maintaining system stability.

## Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-4)
**Objective**: Establish the foundational elements required for the platform

#### Week 1: Project Setup
- **Monorepo Structure**
  - Tool: Nx (for TypeScript/Node.js monorepos with excellent plugin support)
  - Package structure:
    ```
    /apps
      /api         # Backend API
      /web         # Frontend web app
      /mobile      # Future mobile app
    /libs
      /shared      # Shared utilities and types
      /auth        # Authentication logic
      /database    # Database models and migrations
    /tools        # Build and deployment scripts
    ```
- **CI/CD Pipeline**

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **UI Library**: Material-UI with custom theming
- **Build Tools**: Webpack, Babel, ESLint, Prettier
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: NestJS
- **API Protocol**: REST + GraphQL
- **Authentication**: JWT + OAuth 2.0
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI

### Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)
- **Caching**: Memorystore for Redis
- **Search**: Elasticsearch on GKE
- **File Storage**: Google Cloud Storage

## Development Approach

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests before implementation
- Maintain high test coverage (>80%)
- Use mocking for isolated testing

### 2. API-First Design
- Design APIs before implementation
- Version all APIs
- Document with OpenAPI/Swagger

### 3. Feature Flags
- All new features behind feature flags
- Enable/disable without deployment
- Gradual rollout capabilities

### 4. Code Quality
- Enforce coding standards
- Automated code reviews
- Regular dependency updates

## Infrastructure

### GCP Services
- **Compute**: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- **Database**: Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)
- **Caching**: Memorystore for Redis
- **Storage**: Google Cloud Storage
- **CI/CD**: Cloud Build with Cloud Deploy
- **Monitoring**: Cloud Operations (Stackdriver)

### Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform for all infrastructure
- Version controlled configurations
- Environment parity (dev/staging/prod)

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for APIs
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Performance testing
- Security scanning

### Code Review Process
- Mandatory code reviews
- Automated checks
- Security review for sensitive changes
- Documentation requirements

## Deployment Strategy

### Environments
1. **Development**
   - Individual developer environments
   - Automated testing
   - Fast iteration

2. **Staging**
   - Mirrors production
   - Integration testing
   - Performance testing

3. **Production**
   - Blue/green deployments
   - Canary releases
   - Automated rollback

### Monitoring & Observability
- Real-time monitoring
- Centralized logging
- Performance metrics
- Alerting system

## Success Metrics

### Performance
- API response time < 200ms (p95)
- Page load time < 2s
- System uptime > 99.9%

### Quality
- Test coverage > 80%
